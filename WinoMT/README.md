# WinoMTeus

WinoMTeus is a translated subset of [WinoMT](https://github.com/gabrielStanovsky/mt_gender) that consists of 1,000 sentences. The aim of this adaptation is to evaluate gender stereotypes that emerge when translating sentences involving professions from a genderless language like Basque into a gendered language such as Spanish. This repository also includes the glossary we used to translate the occupations from the original dataset in English in a consistent manner.

## Evaluation

We analyze gender bias by examining the distribution of job entities by gender in the translation outputs, which allows us to identify potential imbalances or tendencies in how models assign gender to professional roles.

1. **Entity extraction**: All nouns preceded by definite articles are extracted from the Spanish translation outputs generated by the models (`extract_entities.py`).
2. **Manual filtering of occupations**: Entities that do not refer to professions or occupations are manually removed. The remaining entities are collected in a single document, where each profession is listed with both its masculine and feminine forms to make counting easier later on. For gender-invariant nouns, we use the preceding article to determine the gender (e.g. *el contable* vs *la contable*).
3. **Occupation normalization**: Translations that clearly referred to the same occupation (e.g. *granjero/granjera* and *campesino/campesina*) were grouped under a single normalized form (e.g. *agricultor/agricultora*) to enable comparison across models.
4. **Model-level counting**: For each model, we computed the overall proportion of masculine and feminine translations usign `evaluate_models.py`. We also identified the 10 occupations most frequently translated in masculine form, and the 10 most frequently translated in feminine form.
5. **Cross-model aggregation**: Normalized gender counts were aggregated across all models, and a minimum frequency threshold (≥10 occurrences) was applied (`evaluate_global.py`). We then computed global masculine/feminine proportions and listed the 20 most masculinized and 20 most feminized occupations.


⚠️ This is a surface-level analysis aimed at providing an initial look at gender patterns in translations. Evaluating stereotypes in more detail is left for future work. This would involve examining labor statistics in the Basque Country or carrying out a large-scale survey to understand how Basque speakers perceive the occupations.
