# WinoMTeus

WinoMTeus is a translated subset of [WinoMT](https://github.com/gabrielStanovsky/mt_gender) that consists of 1,000 sentences. The aim of this adaptation is to evaluate gender stereotypes that emerge when translating sentences involving professions from a genderless language like Basque into a gendered language such as Spanish.
